    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 25, 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Lil Taps is designed with your family's privacy in mind. We don't collect, store, or share any personal
        information about you or your child. Ever.</p>

    <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No names</li>

        <li>No analytics or tracking</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Happens on Your Device</h2>
    <p>All gameplay happens entirely on your device. Nothing is sent to our servers. Your subscription status is managed
        through Apple's App Store, not by us.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use Apple's In-App Purchase system for subscriptions. Apple's privacy policy applies to that transaction. We
        never see your payment information.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Lil Taps is designed for children ages 1-6. We take COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) seriously.
        Since we don't collect any data at all, we're fully compliant.</p>

    <h2>COPPA Compliance</h2>
    <p>Lil Taps is designed for children under 13 when used with adult supervision. We are fully compliant with the
        Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do NOT collect any personal information from children</li>
        <li>We do NOT use cookies or tracking technologies</li>
        <li>We do NOT share any data with third parties</li>
        <li>We do NOT allow third-party advertising</li>
        <li>Parental participation is required for all gameplay</li>
        <li>No child profile creation or accounts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All in-app purchases are gated by iOS parental controls.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we ever change this policy, we'll update the date at the top of this page. We'll also notify users through an
        app update.</p>
